# Tic Tac Toe

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game using technologies such as Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. The artificial intelligence for the game is powered by the Min-Max algorithm.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask using the following command: 

```pip install flask```

## Files

app.py:  This file contains the Flask application, responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving the web interface.

main.py: This is the main file of the Tic Tac Toe game, handling the game logic and restricting the moves.

ai.py:   The AI file implements the Min-Max algorithm for the Tic Tac Toe game. It determines the best move for the computer player.

## Run

Clone the repository : 

``` git clone https://github.com/NakulanT/Tic-Tac-Toe.git ```

```cd Tic-Tac-Toe  ```

command : 

``` python app.py ```

## Gameplay

X -> AI  & O -> User.

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Tic Tac Toe game. The computer player uses the Min-Max algorithm to make optimal moves.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the game further!
